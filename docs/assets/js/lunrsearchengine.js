    "body": "2020/01/12 - The Queen‚Äôs Guard and Queen‚Äôs Life Guard (called King‚Äôs Guard and King‚Äôs Life Guard when the reigning monarch is male) are the names given to contingents of infantry and cavalry soldiers charged with guarding the official royal residences in the United Kingdom. The British Army has regiments of both Horse Guards and Foot Guards predating the English Restoration (1660), and since the reign of King Charles II these regiments have been responsible for guarding the Sovereign‚Äôs palaces. The Guards are fully operational soldiers. The Queen‚Äôs Guard and Queen‚Äôs Life Guard are mounted at the royal residences that come under the operating area of the British Army‚Äôs London District, which is responsible for the administration of the Household Division. This covers Buckingham Palace, St James‚Äôs Palace and the Tower of London, as well as Windsor Castle. The Queen‚Äôs Guard is also mounted at the sovereign‚Äôs other official residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, but not as often as in London. In Edinburgh, the guard is the responsibility of the resident infantry battalion at Redford Barracks. It is not mounted at the Queen‚Äôs private residences at Sandringham or Balmoral.  The Queen‚Äôs Guard is the name given to the contingent of infantry responsible for guarding Buckingham Palace and St James‚Äôs Palace (including Clarence House) in London. The guard is made up of a company of soldiers from a single regiment, which is split in two, providing a detachment for Buckingham Palace and a detachment for St James‚Äôs Palace. Because the Sovereign‚Äôs official residence is still St James‚Äôs, the guard commander (called the captain of the guard) is based there, as are the regiment‚Äôs colours. When the Sovereign is in residence, the Queen‚Äôs Guard numbers three officers and forty other ranks, with four sentries each posted at Buckingham Palace (on the forecourt) and St James‚Äôs Palace (two in Friary Court, two at the entrance to Clarence House). This reduces to three officers and 31 ORs, with two sentries each, when the Sovereign is not in residence. The Queen‚Äôs Guard is not purely ceremonial in nature. They provide sentries during the day and night, and during the later hours, they patrol the grounds of the Palace. Until 1959, the sentries at Buckingham Palace were stationed outside the fence. This stopped following an incident involving a female tourist and a Coldstream Guardsman ‚Äì due to the continued pestering by tourists and sightseers, the guardsman kicked the tourist on the ankle as he marched. The tourist made a complaint to the police and the sentry was confined to barracks for ten days. Not long after, the sentries were moved inside the fence. "

Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one‚Äôs self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character‚Äìthat is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

As in many similar films, such as Jacob‚Äôs Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading: ‚ÄúWhen You Don‚Äôt Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?‚Äù The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident ‚Äì but he had been revived (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre as good as new‚Äù). Dr. Newman: ‚ÄúSimon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002.

Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there‚Äôs a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is. So how do we add spoilers in this theme?: &lt;span class= spoiler &gt;My hidden paragraph here. &lt;/span&gt;"

    "body": "2020/01/01 - French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 7‚Äì8 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world, along with Italian, Spanish, and American wine-producing regions.  French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France‚Äôs regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive wines sold internationally to modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period. Two concepts central to the better French wines are the notion of terroir, which links the style of the wines to the locations where the grapes are grown and the wine is made and the Appellation d‚Äôorigine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) system, replaced by the Appellation d‚ÄôOrigin Prot√©g√©e (AOP) system in 2012. Appellation rules closely define which grape varieties and winemaking practices are approved for classification in each of France‚Äôs several hundred geographically defined appellations, which can cover regions, villages or vineyards. France is the source of many grape varieties (such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, Syrah) that are now planted throughout the world, as well as wine-making practices and styles of wine that have been adopted in other producing countries. Although some producers have benefited in recent years from rising prices and increased demand for some of the prestige wines from Burgundy and Bordeaux, the French wine industry has seen a decline in domestic consumption and internationally, it has had to compete with many new world wines.

    "title": " Culinary Arts in Europe by Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin",
    "body": "2019/12/01 - The origins of culinary began with primitive humans roughly 2 million years ago. There are various theories as to how early humans used fire to cook meat. According to anthropologist Richard Wrangham, author of Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human, primitive humans simply tossed a raw hunk of meat into the flames and watched it sizzle. Another theory claims humans may first have savoured roasted meat by chance when the flesh of a beast killed in a forest fire was found to be more appetizing and easier to chew and digest than the conventional raw meat. Culinary techniques improved with the introduction of earthenware and stoneware, the domestication of livestock, and advancements in agriculture. In early civilizations, the primary employers of professional chefs were kings, aristocrats, or priests. The divide between professional chefs cooking for the wealthy and peasants cooking for their families engendered the development of many cuisines. A great deal of the study of Culinary Arts in Europe was organized by Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, a man famous for his quote ‚ÄúTell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are,‚Äù which has since been mistranslated and oversimplified into ‚ÄúYou are what you eat. ‚Äù Other people helped to parse out the different parts of food science and gastronomy. Over time, increasingly deeper and more detailed studies into foods and the Culinary Arts has led to a greater wealth of knowledge. In Asia, a similar path led to a separate study of the Culinary Arts, which later essentially merged with the Western counterpart. In the modern international marketplace, there is no longer a distinct divide between Western and Eastern foods. Culinary Arts students today, generally speaking, are introduced to the different cuisines of many different cultures from around the world. The Culinary Arts, in the Western world, as a craft and later as a field of study, began to evolve at the end of the Renaissance period. Prior to this, chefs worked in castles, cooking for kings and queens, as well as their families, guests, and other workers of the castle. As Monarchical rule became phased out as a modality, the chefs took their craft to inns and hotels. From here, the craft evolved into a field of study. Before cooking institutions, professional cooks were mentors for individual students who apprenticed under them. In 1879, the first cooking school was founded in the United States: the Boston Cooking School. This school standardized cooking practices and recipes, and laid the groundwork for the culinary arts schools that would follow. "
